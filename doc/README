Rezerwar - a big mess of networked blocks and pipes 
Copyright (C) Bertrand Janin (tamentis@neopulsar.org)

Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as the unlegitimate
child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game.


DISCLAIMER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is a pet project, not in any way a finished product. As stated in the
  license, I am not responsible in case of damage.


INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  From source, you will need gcc, make and SDL. If you plan on altering the
  gfx, sfx or musics, you will need mikmod (musics), inkscape (gfx), lame.

  Use ./configure to setup the build environment, with your platform as only
  parameter. For example:

  ./configure Linux
  make
  make install

  The install will put all the data files in /usr/share/games/rezerwar and 
  the game will be installed in /usr/games. Feel free to edit this in 
  config.h and Makefile.


WINDOWS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On win32 you need to install msys and mingw32 to compile rezerwar. If you
  feel like creating a Visual Studio project file, go crazy.

  ./configure Win32
  make


NINTENDO WII
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You need DevKitPro to build rezerwar on the Wii.

  ./configure Wii
  make


SOUNDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sampled from freesound.org with Audacity:

GRAPHICS

MUSIC

HOW TO PLAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You have to position falling blocks to align their pipes and let water
  "flow" to create "networks". You get points by closing networks, the
  bigger the network, the more points you get.


"NETWORK"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A network is the name of a set of pipe-connected cubes. When a network is
  closed with water, it gets destroyed.


AVALANCHE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When a network is connected from one end of the screen to the next... the
  water turns red. As soon as the network is completely closed, the network
  is destroyed and with it all the cube below it. This is the most score
  rewarding trick in Rezerwar.


LEVEL FORMAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The levels are simple text files, here are the rules to edit/create them:
  
   - The lines starting with '#' are ignored completely.
   - Blank lines (i.e. no char at all) are used as delimiters.
   - The first non-blank line is the title of the level (Max 64)
   - The first paragraph after the title and a blank line is the
     description of the level, it will appear as soon as the level
     loads.
   - The set of characters after represent the grid of the initial
     cubes.


UPDATES, PATCHES, LEVELS, MUSICS, etc.:

  I do accept all contributions, just drop me a mail at tamentis@neopulsar.org
