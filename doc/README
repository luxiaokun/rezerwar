Rezerwar - a big mess of networked blocks and pipes 
Copyright (C) Bertrand Janin (tamentis@neopulsar.org)

WTF?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as the illegitimate
  child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game. This child was ditched out
  of the house early and enjoyed a wanderer life stealing toys from other kids.


DISCLAIMER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is not a finished game, it could be renamed "My never-ending 2d puzzle
  pet project game". The game might evolve radically or not change for 10
  years. But it's OpenSource, so feel free to destroy/construct with me. I am
  not responsible in case of damage, material or psychological.


INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  From source, you will need gcc, make and SDL. If you plan on altering the
  gfx, sfx or musics, you will need mikmod (musics), inkscape (gfx), lame and
  the gimp.

  Use ./configure to setup the build environment, with your platform as only
  parameter. For example:

  ./configure Linux
  make
  make install

  The install will put all the data files in /usr/share/games/rezerwar and 
  the game will be installed in /usr/games. Feel free to edit this in 
  config.h and Makefile.


WINDOWS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On win32 you need to install msys and mingw32 to compile rezerwar. If you
  feel like creating a Visual Studio project file, go crazy.

  ./configure Win32
  make


NINTENDO WII
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You need DevKitPro to build rezerwar on the Wii.

  ./configure Wii
  make


SOUNDS

  Edited/resampled with Audacity from sounds on freesound.org:

GRAPHICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Created with Inkscape and The Gimp by myself.


MUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Created with ChibiTracker by myself too.


HOW TO PLAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You have to position falling blocks to align their pipes and let water
  "flow" to create "networks". You get points by closing networks, the
  bigger the network, the more points you get. From time to time you will
  get a Dynamite, this will help you clear your path.

  You also might get annoyed by the moles digging around your board. If they
  blow a pipe, this pipe won't be able to give water until you fix it with
  a medic cube.


AVALANCHE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When a network is connected from one end of the screen to the next... the
  water turns red. As soon as the network is completely closed, the network
  is destroyed and with it all the cube below it. This is the most score
  rewarding trick in Rezerwar.


LEVEL FORMAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The levels are simple text files, here are the rules to edit/create them:
  
   - The lines starting with '#' are ignored completely.
   - Blank lines (i.e. no char at all) are used as delimiters.
   - The first non-blank line is the title of the level (Max 64)
   - The first paragraph after the title and a blank line is the
     description of the level, it will appear as soon as the level
     loads.
   - The set of characters after represent the grid of the initial
     cubes.


UPDATES, PATCHES, LEVELS, MUSICS, etc.:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I do accept all contributions, just drop me a mail at tamentis@neopulsar.org
  and I'll include your stuff in the next release, if there is any ;)

  One good start is to checkout the SVN to get the real full source dump and
  ./configure Debug.


KNOWN ISSUES / TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - wii: bug - the music chirps from time to time, I have no idea why.
 - wii: bug - no way to enter your name in hiscores, defaults to 'wiiuser'.
 - wii: bug - no way to accelerate the fall of a block.
 - wii: add a screen to explain what buttons to use
 - wii: transitions are slow and buggy
 - all: add more tutorial levels.
 - all: complete the musics
