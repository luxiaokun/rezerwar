rezerwar - a big mess of networked piped cubes


WTF?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as the
  illegitimate child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game. I
  adopted this bastard child and tried to give it some life.

  I started it as a tetris-clone, it actually had real tetrominoes at
  some point, rain was involved with water physics at another point.


INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  From source, you will need gcc, GNU make, SDL and SDL_mixer. If you
  plan on altering any of the data, you will need some more tools such
  as inkscape, the gimp, oggenc, schism tracker, etc..

  Use ./configure to setup the build environment, unless your platform
  is undetected in which case you can try a close match as first
  parameter.

      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install

  If you are porting/packaging rezerwar, most of the destination 
  directory can be specified as environment variable to the ./configure.

  If you loaded rezerwar from svn/hg/... you will need to build the
  data first, go in data/ and type make.


WINDOWS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On win32 you need to install msys and mingw32 to compile rezerwar. If
  you feel like creating a Visual Studio project file, please share.


NINTENDO WII
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You need DevKitPro to build rezerwar on the Wii, and you will need to
  run configure this way:

      ./configure Wii


SOUNDS, MUSIC & GRAPHICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sounds were edited/resampled with Audacity from freesound.org sounds:
    - Start Horn by Vann Westfold
    - Rotating sound "Clock Ticking" by jackstrebor
    - Falling block "deepkickclean" by johnnypanic
    - Bomb block "Boom" by DJ Chronos
    - Network boom "possiblelazer" aust_paul
    - Menu nav "Menu Nav 3" by DJ Chronos
    - Menu Select "f3-sfx-menu-select.wav" by broumbroum
    - Drowning mole "ELEMENTS_WATER_02_Phasin-bubbles.wav" by suonho

  Backgrounds & sprites were created with Inkscape and The Gimp.

  Music was created with ChibiTracker then SchismTracker.


HOW TO PLAY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cubes with pipes are falling from the top, you need to use your arrow
  or vi keys to let the cubes fall in an organized manner. When pipes
  are connecting to the left or right side of the board, blue or green
  water will flow through them. The goal of this game is to get high
  scores, in order to get points you need to complete the longest
  networks of pipes (with water) as fast as possible. You may also
  gain points from:

    - Fixing a broken pipe
    - Completing a 'red' network
    - Not using the 'Hold' key, at all


SPECIAL CUBES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Dynamite: This cube will destroy a complete row or column. It does not
      produce any points but will usually be helpful to get out of some
      complex situation. It could also be annoying as you might now want
      anything to be destroyed. In this case, you need to find the
      safest place for it to explod.

  Medic: This cube has two functions. First it will transform all the
      cubes above, below and aside of itself into 'all-way' cubes,
      helping to solve complex and stuck networks. The second function
      is to fix a broken pipe (see lower), which give points.


MOLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Appart from the stress of organisation, you will also have little
  moles crawling around your rezerwar. Then wander, sleep and sometimes
  bump into your supplying pipes. When this happens, the supplying pipe
  will blow, drowning the mole. This pipe won't be able to supply water
  until you bring a medic cube in front of it.


RED NETWORKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When a network is connected from one end of the screen to the next...
  the water turns red. As soon as the network is completely closed, the
  network is destroyed and with it all the cube below it. This is the
  most score rewarding trick in Rezerwar.


COMBOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you keep on completing networks, without interruption, you will
  raise your combo level and every point you make will be multiplicated
  by this value.
  

LEVEL FORMAT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The levels are simple text files, here are the rules to edit/create them:
  
   - The lines starting with '#' are ignored
   - Blank lines (i.e. no char at all) are used as delimiters
   - The first non-blank line is the title of the level (Max 64)
   - The first paragraph after the title and a blank line is the
     description of the level, it will appear as soon as the level
     loads.
   - The set of characters after represent the grid of the initial
     cubes.
   - The next chunk is a definition of the cubes to be sent to the
     player, in reverse order. Letter equivalents could be found
     in the source file 'cube.c'.
   - After that, the lines starting with '$' are all variables
     defining level internals.
