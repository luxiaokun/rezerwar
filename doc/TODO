BUILD:
 - if a file is not found in the datapath, always look in ./data and ../data
   so the game can run without install.

DATA:
 - more tutorials
 - create a level2 music, a tad faster, when it gets harder.
 - Add a plane passing with random messages.
 - create a medic overlay sprite for the medic block mode.

GAME PLAY:
 - make menus smarter with paging?
 - allow users to pick their tutorial in a list.
 - show a little fountain/leak when a network is opened.
 - let people enter their name without keyboard (consoles...)
    * create 'Prompt' which wraps 'Text'
    * add a blinking cursor to show the current position.

OPTIMIZATION:
 - 'Text' items should cache their surface, even with effects, for one frame
   to the next.
 - Keep the list of all the updated rect and only update those.
 - make the transitions smarter/faster.

DOCUMENTATION / SITE:
 - startup flags.
 - move the site to be a little friendlier, and create some basic documentation.
 - how to use medics

WII
 - bug - the music chirps from time to time, I have no idea why.
 - bug - no way to enter your name in hiscores, defaults to 'wiiuser'.
 - bug - no way to accelerate the fall of a block.
 - add a screen to explain what buttons to use
 - transitions are slow and buggy
 - get meta.xml updated from configure.
