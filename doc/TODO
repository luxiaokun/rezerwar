ROADMAP TO 0.4:
 - go through the game's tutorials,
    - add a tutorial about medics
    - add a tutorial about moles
 - find out why 'q' on the intro/description seems to hang.
 - test configure on win32, haiku, wii, freebsd.
 - create a mario transition, optimized and clean, remove
   the other ones.
 - documentation.
 - tab all the structs.
 - add a comment on each func.


DATA:
 - more tutorials
 - create a level2 music, a tad faster, when it gets harder.
 - Add a plane passing with random messages.
 - create a medic overlay sprite for the medic block mode.

GAME PLAY:
 - show a little fountain/leak when a network is opened.
 - let people enter their name without keyboard (consoles...)
    * create 'Prompt' which wraps 'Text'
    * add a blinking cursor to show the current position.

OPTIMIZATION:
 - 'Text' items should cache their surface, even with effects, for one frame
   to the next.
 - Keep the list of all the updated rect and only update those.
 - make the transitions smarter.

DOCUMENTATION / SITE:
 - startup flags.
 - document the Combos, Avalanche, etc...
 - move the site to be a little friendlier, and create some basic documentation.
 - how to use medics
