DISTRIBUTION:
 - test configure on win32, haiku, wii, freebsd.

 - create a boom sprite for the dynamite block.

GAME PLAY:
 - show a little fountain/leak when a network is opened.
 - make sure new moles are created when other die.
 - when difficulty increases, more moles appear.

   (and all other newly generated lines actually)

 - Keep the list of all the updated rect and only update those.
 - go through the XXX/TODOs, move magic numbers as constants...

 - startup flags.
