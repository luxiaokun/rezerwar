Rezerwar - a big mess of networked blocks and pipes
Copyright (C) Bertrand Janin (tamentis@neopulsar.org)

Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as the unlegitimate
child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game.

HOW TO PLAY:
  You have to position falling blocks to align their pipes align and let the
  water flow to create "networks". You get points by closing networks, the
  bigger the network, the more points you get.

NETWORK:
  A network is the name of a set of pipe-connected cubes. When a network is
  closed, it gets destroyed and might cause deflagration.

DEFLAGRATION:
  When a closed network of cubes is completed, depending on the number of cubes
  in the network and the difficulty level, you might trigger a cube
  deflagration. This means all the neighoring cubes around the network will be
  destroyed along with the cubes of the network itself. Here are the number
  of cubes required per difficulty level:

      Easiest: 5
      Easy:    8
      Medium:  12
      Hard:    16
      Ultra:   20

TODO:
 - When two networks connect from different starts, everything underneath
   disappears.
 - Give the menu a 'mask' frame, make the option menu bigger and work on a
   way to page through the lines.
 - Create a 'Text' type with parameters...
 - Add color option to 'Text', replacing white pixels or black pixels.
 - Add an option to show/hide FPS.
 - Add High Score (create a simple file format).
 - Move all the SDL related stuff in wrappers within sdl_engine.c
 - Menu
 - Music
 - Create a block_allocate when creating new blocks to avoid always pushing
   blocks at the end of the array.
 - You can harden blocks so they can last a couple generations of water, this
   will help exploding center areas.

BUGS:
 - If a block is stuck between two columns of block or the side of the board,
   don't let the block rotate or it will get stuck. Ideas to fix this:
    * calculate the next position before actually changing and check if there are other
      blocks in the way.
