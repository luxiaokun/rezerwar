CONTINUATION:
 - Instead of getting the neighbor cube by default... use get the type first,
   then decide what to do.

FEATURES:
 - Create other collections of pieces (3 blocks, 5 blocks)
 - Move all the SDL related stuff in wrappers within sdl_engine.c
 - Menu
 - Music
 - Create a block_allocate when creating new blocks to avoid always pushing
   blocks at the end of the array.
 - You can harden blocks so they can last a couple generations of water, this
   will help exploding center areas.

BUGS:
 - If a block is stuck between two columns of block or the side of the board,
   don't let the block rotate or it will get stuck.
