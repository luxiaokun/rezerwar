Rezerwar - a big mess of networked blocks and pipes 
Copyright (C) Bertrand Janin (tamentis@neopulsar.org)

Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as the unlegitimate
child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game.

HOW TO PLAY:
  You have to position falling blocks to align their pipes align and let the
  water flow to create "networks". You get points by closing networks, the
  bigger the network, the more points you get.

NETWORK:
  A network is the name of a set of pipe-connected cubes. When a network is
  closed, it gets destroyed and might cause deflagration.

DEFLAGRATION (obsolete)
  When a closed network of cubes is completed, depending on the number of cubes
  in the network and the difficulty level, you might trigger a cube
  deflagration. This means all the neighoring cubes around the network will be
  destroyed along with the cubes of the network itself. Here are the number
  of cubes required per difficulty level:

      Easiest: 5
      Easy:    8
      Medium:  12
      Hard:    16
      Ultra:   20

AVALANCHE:
  When a network is connected from one end of the screen to the next... the
  water turns red. As soon as the network is completely closed, the network
  is destroyed and with it all the cube below it. This is at the time the
  most score rewarding trick in Rezerwar.


LEVEL FORMAT:
  The levels are simple text files, here are the rules to edit/create them:
  
   - The lines starting with '#' are ignored completely.
   - Blank lines (i.e. no char at all) are used as delimiters.
   - The first non-blank line is the title of the level (Max 64)
   - The first paragraph after the title and a blank line is the
     description of the level, it will appear as soon as the level
     loads.
   - The set of characters after represent the grid of the initial
     cubes.
