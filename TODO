 - add a timed mode to clean the screen.
 - add a 'tutorial' that shows how to play.
 - add blue and red blocks which will freeze and thaw the water.
 - Sound -> add a didjeridou sound at the beginning or accordeon, something cacophinic.
 - Move all the SDL related stuff in wrappers within sdl_engine.c
 - add mouse interfacing in-game to allow Maemo and iPhone to work.
 - Music
 - Add an 'under pressure' block that can provide pressure for a couple
   blocks. If you don't complete the network in 10 seconds, it depletes.
 - Add a bomb block, when it falls, it destroys everything in a 1 block
   radius.
 - Add an acid block, it melts all the blocks  underneath, vertically.
 - add an atomic block, it nukes all the blocks on the same level, horizontaly
 - Create a block_allocate when creating new blocks to avoid always pushing
   blocks at the end of the array.
 - You can harden blocks so they can last a couple generations of water, this
   will help exploding center areas.
 - Give the menu a 'mask' frame, make the option menu bigger and work on a
   way to page through the lines.

NOTES FROM OTHER GAME SOURCES:
 - Would it be interesting to use a memoryPool like in q3a?
    - you are doing it for the cubes on the board already.
