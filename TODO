 - have some form of high light to show what block you are hovering.
 - add mouse interfacing in-game to allow Maemo and iPhone to work.
    - don't let block move behind cubes... (can_move type thing)
 - allow *ANY* block to move around.
 - when a network is complete, gray it out for a second before destroying it,
   then destroy it faster (timed?).

 - add a line at the bottom of the board that progresses to show when the
   next line is added.
 - improve musics!

 - Contaminated water? with a little radioactive sign. Avoid connecting
   to any network!
 - Growing vegetation in the rezerwar?

 - Create a block_allocate when creating new blocks to avoid always pushing
   blocks at the end of the array.
 - Give the menu a 'mask' frame, make the option menu bigger and work on a
   way to page through the lines.

NOTES FROM OTHER GAME SOURCES:
 - Would it be interesting to use a memoryPool like in q3a?
    - you are doing it for the cubes on the board already.
